A 2d RPG game, with turn-based combat, quests, shops, and traumatised npcs. 
  With the theme of childhood imagination, most design choices are made based on the main character. An example would be the turn based battle system. 
  The main character would always wait for it's oponent to have a reply to his action before continuing with his own action. It is simply impolite to continue without.
